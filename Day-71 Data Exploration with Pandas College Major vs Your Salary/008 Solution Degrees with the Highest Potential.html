<p>Here's the solution to the challenge from the previous lesson: </p><p><strong>Majors with the Highest Potential</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">highest_potential = clean_df.sort_values('Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary', ascending=False)
highest_potential[['Undergraduate Major', 'Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary']].head()</pre><p><strong>Majors with the Greatest Spread in Salaries</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">highest_spread = clean_df.sort_values('Spread', ascending=False)
highest_spread[['Undergraduate Major', 'Spread']].head()</pre><p>Notice how 3 of the top 5 are present in both. This means that there are some very high earning Economics degree holders out there, but also some who are not earning as much. It's actually quite interesting to compare these two rankings versus the degrees where the median salary is very high. </p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-22_14-38-55-99cb7032f8f52f4439897970b72b7bfc.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;"></figure>
