<p><strong>Find College Major with Highest Starting Salaries</strong> </p><p>To access a particular column from a data frame we can use the square bracket notation, like so:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Starting Median Salary']</pre><p>You should see all the values printed out below the cell for just this column:</p><figure><img height="291" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-22_11-43-02-a2d17fe32f141cfc42f3b7c60d7b646c.png" width="372"></figure><p>To find the highest starting salary we can simply chain the <code>.max()</code> method. </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].max()</pre><p>The highest starting salary is $74,300. But which college major earns this much on average?&nbsp;For this, we need to know the row number or <strong>index</strong> so that we can look up the name of the major. Lucky for us, the <code>.idxmax()</code> method will give us index for the row with the largest value. </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].idxmax()</pre><p>which is 43. To see the name of the major that corresponds to that particular row, we can use the <code>.loc</code> (location) property. </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Undergraduate Major'].loc[43]</pre><p>Here we are selecting both a column ('Undergraduate Major') and a row at index 43, so we are retrieving the value of a particular cell.
