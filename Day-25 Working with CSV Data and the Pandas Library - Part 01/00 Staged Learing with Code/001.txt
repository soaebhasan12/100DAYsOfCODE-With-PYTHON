The lecture introduces Day 25 of the "100 Days of Code" challenge, focusing on working with CSV files and analyzing data using the Pandas library, one of the most popular Python libraries for data analysis. The goal is to learn how to extract insights from data files. By the end of the day, participants will create an interactive and educational game where players guess and learn the names of all 50 U.S. states. The game is inspired by a quiz on Sporcle, where users guess states, and their names appear on a map. The lecture emphasizes the educational and fun aspects of the project while providing a practical introduction to data handling with Pandas.
