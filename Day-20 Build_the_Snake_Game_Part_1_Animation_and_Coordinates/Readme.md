# 🐍 Classic Snake Game using Python (Turtle Graphics)

Welcome to the **Day 20 & 21 Project** of the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge!  
In this project, we build the **classic Snake Game** using **Python's Turtle module** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

> 📱 Inspired by the legendary Nokia 3310 game 🕹️

---

## 📽️ Project Summary

This project is a step-by-step recreation of the classic snake game, where:
- The snake moves using arrow keys.
- Eats food and grows longer.
- Game ends if snake hits wall or itself.
- Score is displayed in real-time.

---

## 📚 Concepts Used

- Python 🐍
- OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, etc.)
- Turtle Graphics 🐢
- Collision Detection
- Event-driven programming
- Random module (for food placement)

---

## 🎮 Game Features

✅ Moving snake (controlled via keyboard)  
✅ Food generation at random positions  
✅ Snake grows after eating food  
✅ Live scoreboard  
✅ Game over conditions:
- Hits wall
- Hits own body

## 🛠️ How the Game is Built

- The entire project is divided into **7 Steps**, tackled across **2 days**:

### 🧩 Day 20 - Step 1 to Step 3:
1. **Create the snake body** using 3 square segments.
2. **Move the snake** forward continuously.
3. **Control snake** using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).

### 🍕 Day 21 - Step 4 to Step 7:
4. **Add food** to the screen.
5. **Detect collision** with food & grow snake.
6. **Score tracking** & scoreboard.
7. **Game over conditions**:
   - Snake hits wall
   - Snake hits itself

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- How to break a game into smaller OOP components.

- Writing modular, clean, and reusable code.

- Handling keyboard events using turtle.

- Game logic design and collision detection.

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Add sound effects 🎵

- Difficulty levels 🚀

- High score saving using file handling 💾

- GUI start/restart screen with Tkinter 🖼️
