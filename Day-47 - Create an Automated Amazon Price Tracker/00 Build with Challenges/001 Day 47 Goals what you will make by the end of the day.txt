1. Project: Amazon Price Tracker Bot using Python

2. Goal: Track Amazon product price daily and alert via email if price drops below target

3. Web Scraping: Extract price from Amazon using HTML tag

4. SMTP Module: Send email when price < target price

5. Automation: Bot checks price daily at fixed time (e.g. 9:00 AM)

6. Use case: Saves time by avoiding daily manual price checking

7. Reference: camelcamelcamel.com shows product price history

8. Target Price: Set price limit (e.g. $99), alert if product drops below this

9. Output: Email alert with current price and product link
