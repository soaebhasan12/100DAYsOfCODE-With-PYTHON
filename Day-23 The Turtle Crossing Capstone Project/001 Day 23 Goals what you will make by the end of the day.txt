Game Concept:

The player controls a turtle that can only move forward.
The goal is to cross a busy highway with randomly generated cars moving horizontally.
If the turtle reaches the other side, the cars speed up, and the turtle resets to the starting position.
The game ends when the turtle collides with a car.
Learning Objectives:

Practice creating and inheriting classes.
Use objects from classes.
Apply knowledge of the turtle module, including its coordinate system and game engine.
Next Steps:

Access the starting code and choose a difficulty level in the next lesson.
