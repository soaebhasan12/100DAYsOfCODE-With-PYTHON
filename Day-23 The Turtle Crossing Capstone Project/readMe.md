# Turtle Crossing Game 🐢🚗

This project is part of the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp (Day 23). It is a capstone project where you build a fun and interactive Turtle Crossing game using Python's `turtle` module.

## 🎮 Game Concept

The game is inspired by **Crossy Road**. The player controls a turtle that must cross a busy highway filled with randomly generated cars. 

### Gameplay:
- The turtle can only move forward.
- The goal is to cross the highway without colliding with any cars.
- If the turtle reaches the other side:
  - The cars speed up.
  - The turtle resets to the starting position to cross again.
- The game ends when the turtle collides with a car.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project reinforces key Python concepts, including:
- Creating and inheriting classes.
- Using objects created from classes.
- Working with the `turtle` module, including its coordinate system and game engine.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-crossing-game.git
   cd turtle-crossing-game
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
