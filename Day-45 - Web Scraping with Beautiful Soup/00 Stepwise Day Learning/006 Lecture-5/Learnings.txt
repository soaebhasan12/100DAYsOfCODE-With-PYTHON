006: 100 Movies That You Must Watch


Project Goal:

Scrape Empire’s Top 100 Movies list.

Save titles in reverse order (1 to 100) in movies.txt.

Steps:

Fetch HTML: Use requests.get() to retrieve the webpage.

Parse with Beautiful Soup: Extract all <h3> tags with class="title".

Reverse Order: Use slicing ([::-1]) to flip the list.

Save to File: Write each movie title to movies.txt.









Interview Points
Q: How did you identify the correct HTML tags to scrape?
A: Used Chrome DevTools to inspect the page—movie titles were in <h3 class="title">.

Q: Why reverse the list?
A: The webpage lists movies from 100 to 1; slicing ([::-1]) reorders them from 1 to 100.

Q: How would you handle dynamic content (e.g., JavaScript-loaded data)?
A: Use selenium or requests-html to render JS before scraping.

Q: Ethical considerations for this project?
A: Checked robots.txt (no restrictions), scraped only public data, and added no aggressive request delays.
