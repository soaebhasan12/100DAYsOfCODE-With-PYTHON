welcome to Day 45 of 100 Days of Code. Now,
today, we're going to be getting back to coding with Python,
and we're going to be learning how to scrape the web for data
using a module called BeautifulSoup.
Now we've been working with APIs for quite a while now,
and we know that 
we can use a website's API to access their data or to interact with the
website using code.
But some websites don't have an API or their API
doesn't let us do all the things that we want to do.
So this is where we start thinking about using web scraping
where we look through the underlying HTML code
of a website to get hold of the information that we want.

So the aim of today is to learn how to make soup,
but not this kind of soup. We're going to be making BeautifulSoup.
