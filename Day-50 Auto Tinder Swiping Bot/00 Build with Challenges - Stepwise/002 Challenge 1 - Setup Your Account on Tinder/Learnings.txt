### **Lecture Learnings** (Key Concepts Explained)

1. **Tinder Mechanics**:
   - Dating app where users "swipe right" to like and "swipe left" to dislike profiles
   - Mutual likes = "match" enabling chat

2. **Problem Statement**:
   - Low match rates (~0.4-1% of swipes)
   - High time investment (~90 mins/day average)

3. **Automation Opportunity**:
   - Replace manual swiping with a bot using:
     - **Selenium**: Browser automation tool
     - **Python**: Scripting logic

4. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Disclose bot usage to avoid relationship conflicts
   - Option to use AI-generated profiles (thispersondoesnotexist.com)

5. **Tinder Limits**:
   - Free tier: 100 swipes/day
   - Premium tiers: Unlimited swipes

### **Notes** (Minimalist Cheatsheet)

```python
# Core Tools:
- Selenium (automate browser actions)
- Python (logic/control flow)

# Key Actions:
1. Login via Facebook
2. Locate swipe buttons (XPath/CSS)
3. Auto-swipe right/left
4. Handle match popups
5. Respect daily swipe limits (100/day free)
```

### **Forever-Remember Interview Points**

1. **Real-World Automation**:
   - "This project demonstrates how scripting can solve repetitive tasks, saving ~90 mins/day for users."

2. **Web Scraping Ethics**:
   - "Always check a website's ToS before automation; some platforms prohibit bots."

3. **Selenium Use-Cases**:
   - "Beyond testing, Selenium automates workflows like form submissions, data extraction, and in this case, swiping actions."

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - "Even a 1% efficiency gain in high-frequency tasks (like swiping) compounds significantly over time."

### **Tinder Bot-Specific Insights**

1. **Bot Workflow**:
   - Login → Dismiss popups → Swipe → Handle matches → Repeat

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Network delays (use `try-except`)
   - Daily swipe limits (counter variable)
   - Captchas (risk with automation)

3. **Alternatives**:
   - Physical "Tinder Finger" vs. software bot
   - Swipe left-only mode for practice without matches
