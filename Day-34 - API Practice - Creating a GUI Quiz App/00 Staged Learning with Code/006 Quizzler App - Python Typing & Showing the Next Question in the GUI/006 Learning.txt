1. How do you display dynamic data, such as questions from an API, in a GUI application?
Solution:
Fetch the data from the API, store it in a data structure, and update the GUI elements (like labels or canvas text) with the fetched data when needed.

2. What is separation of concerns, and why is it important in application design?
Solution:
Separation of concerns means dividing a program into distinct sections, each handling a specific responsibility (e.g., UI vs. business logic). This makes the code more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand.

3. How can you pass data or logic between different classes in Python?
Solution:
By passing instances of one class as parameters to another class (dependency injection), you allow classes to interact and share logic or data.

4. What are type hints in Python, and how do they improve code quality and development experience?
Solution:
Type hints specify the expected data types of variables, function parameters, and return values. They help catch errors early, improve code completion, and make the code more readable.

5. How would you ensure that long text fits properly within a UI element, such as a canvas or label?
Solution:
Set the width or wraplength property of the UI element so that long text automatically wraps and fits within the designated area.

6. What is dependency injection, and how does it help in designing flexible and testable code?
Solution:
Dependency injection is the practice of passing dependencies (like objects or services) into a class rather than creating them inside the class. This makes the code more modular, flexible, and easier to test.

7. Why is it beneficial to keep UI logic and business logic in separate modules or classes?
Solution:
It allows each part of the code to focus on a single responsibility, making the application easier to maintain, extend, and debug.

8. Can you explain how type hints can help prevent runtime errors in Python applications?
Solution:
Type hints allow static analysis tools and IDEs to detect type mismatches before running the code, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors due to incorrect data types.

9. How do you update a UI element in response to changes in the underlying data model?
Solution:
Fetch the updated data from the model and use the appropriate method (e.g., itemconfig for a canvas text) to update the UI element with the new value.

10. What are some best practices for designing maintainable and user-friendly GUI applications?
Solution:
Separate UI and business logic
Use type hints
Pass dependencies via constructors
Make UI elements responsive to data changes
Ensure text and controls are user-friendly and accessible
