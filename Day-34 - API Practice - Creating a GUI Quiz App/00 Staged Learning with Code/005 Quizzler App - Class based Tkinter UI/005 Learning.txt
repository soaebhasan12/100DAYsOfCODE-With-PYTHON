one line issue and solution:
Issue:
The initial attempt to add text to the tkinter Canvas using create_text caused a "tuple index out of range" error.

Solution:
Always provide the X and Y coordinates as the first two arguments to create_text (e.g., self.canvas.create_text(150, 125, ...)) to correctly position the text on the canvas and avoid this error.
