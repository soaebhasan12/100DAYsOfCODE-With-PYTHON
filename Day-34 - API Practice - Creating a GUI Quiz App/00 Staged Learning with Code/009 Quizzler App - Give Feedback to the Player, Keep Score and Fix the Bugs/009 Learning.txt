Key Learnings
Visual Feedback in GUI:
Instead of printing feedback to the console, you can give visual feedback in the GUI by changing the background color of the canvas (green for correct, red for incorrect).

Returning Boolean from check_answer:
The check_answer method should return True or False instead of printing, so the UI can react accordingly.

Using give_feedback:
The give_feedback method changes the canvas color based on whether the answer was correct, then uses self.window.after(1000, self.get_next_question) to wait 1 second before moving to the next question.

Why Not Use time.sleep:
In Tkinter, using time.sleep would freeze the GUI. Instead, use window.after to schedule actions without blocking the interface.

Resetting the Canvas:
After showing feedback, reset the canvas background to white in get_next_question.

Disabling Buttons at End:
When the quiz ends, disable the True/False buttons to prevent further input.

Score Keeping:
Update the score label every time a new question is shown.










Answers to Your Doubts
Why use self.window.after(1000, self.get_next_question) and not with parentheses?
Passing the function name (without parentheses) schedules it to run after 1 second. If you use parentheses, the function runs immediately.

Why does give_feedback not work if you use parentheses?
Because self.window.after(1000, self.get_next_question()) calls the function right away and passes its result (None) to after, so nothing happens after 1 second.

Why use self.quiz.check_answer()?
self.quiz is an instance of the QuizBrain class, which contains the quiz logic. The UI class delegates answer checking to this object.












Interview Questions
Why should you avoid using time.sleep in a Tkinter GUI application?
Because it blocks the mainloop, freezing the GUI and making it unresponsive.

How can you provide feedback to the user in a Tkinter app after a button press?
By changing widget properties (like background color) and using after to schedule further actions.

What is the purpose of returning a boolean from the check_answer method?
It allows the UI to know if the answer was correct and provide appropriate feedback.

How do you disable a Tkinter button?
By setting its state option to "disabled".

How do you update a label in Tkinter to show the current score?
By calling the labelâ€™s config method with the new text.

What happens if you pass a function call (with parentheses) to after instead of the function name?
The function executes immediately, and after receives its return value (usually None), so nothing is scheduled.
