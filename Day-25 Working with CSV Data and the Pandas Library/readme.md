# Day 25: Working with CSV Data and the Pandas Library 📊🐼

Welcome to **Day 25** of the "100 Days of Code" challenge! Today, we focus on working with **CSV files** and analyzing data using the **Pandas library**, one of the most popular Python libraries for data analysis.

## Goals for the Day 🎯

By the end of the day, you will:
- 🗂️ Learn how to work with CSV files and extract insights from data.
- 📈 Understand how to use the Pandas library for data analysis.
- 🎮 Build an **interactive and educational game** where players guess and learn the names of all 50 U.S. states.

## Project Overview 🌎

The project for today is inspired by a quiz on Sporcle. The game:
- 🗺️ Displays a blank map of the United States.
- ✏️ Allows players to guess the names of U.S. states.
- ✅ Fills in the map with the correct state names as players guess them.
- 🏆 Challenges players to name as many states as possible, up to all 50.

### Features of the Game 🎲
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players input state names, and the map updates dynamically.
- **Educational Value**: Helps players learn and remember the names of U.S. states.
- **Fun Challenge**: Test your knowledge and see how many states you can name!

## Learning Objectives 📚

- 🛠️ Work with CSV files to read and manipulate data.
- ⚡ Use the Pandas library to analyze and process data efficiently.
- 🧠 Apply Python programming skills to create an engaging and educational game.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
3. ▶️ Run the game script and start guessing the names of U.S. states!

## Inspiration 💡

This game is inspired by a **Sporcle quiz** where users guess state names, and their locations appear on a blank map. It's a fun and educational way to test your knowledge of U.S. geography.
