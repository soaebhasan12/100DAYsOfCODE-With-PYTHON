### **Lecture 001: Day 49 Goals - Automating LinkedIn Job Applications**  

#### **New Terms:**  
1. **Selenium WebDriver**: A tool for automating browser actions (like clicking buttons, filling forms) programmatically.  
   - *Analogy*: A robot controlling your mouse/keyboard to use a website.  
2. **Easy Apply**: LinkedIn feature allowing quick job applications with minimal steps.  
3. **Job Seeking Preferences**: LinkedIn settings to pre-upload resumes/configure job search behavior.  

#### **Notes:**  
- **Project Goal**: Build a bot to automate LinkedIn "Easy Apply" job applications.  
- **Steps to Automate**:  
  1. Login to LinkedIn.  
  2. Search for jobs (filter by role/location/remote).  
  3. Click "Easy Apply".  
  4. Fill required fields (phone number, resume upload).  
  5. Submit application.  
- **Pre-requisite**: Upload resume in LinkedIn’s *Job Seeking Preferences*.  

#### **Interview Points:**  
- **Q**: Why use Selenium for job application automation?  
  **A**: Selenium mimics human interaction with browsers, handling dynamic elements like buttons/forms, making it ideal for repetitive tasks like job applications.  
- **Q**: What’s the ethical consideration when automating LinkedIn applications?  
  **A**: Only automate for genuine applications; avoid spamming. Use responsibly to save time, not exploit systems.
