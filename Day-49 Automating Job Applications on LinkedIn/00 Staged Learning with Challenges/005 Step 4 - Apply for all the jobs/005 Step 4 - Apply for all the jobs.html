<p>Now that we've verified that we can automatically apply to a job, the next step to apply to all the jobs on the page!</p><p>There's a couple of things that we're going to ignore to make it easier:</p><p>1. We're only going to apply to the standard, 1-step applications e.g.</p><p><img height="412" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-20_11-41-07-face0404f0fff28b17fa7029257ceb08.png" width="468"></p><p>2. We're going to ignore the applications that require a note, e.g.</p><figure><img height="341" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-20_14-22-46-d66582b7ab9b8d2397422ed9dfe898d2.png" width="333"></figure><p>3. We're going to ignore the complex, multi-step applications, e.g.</p><figure><img height="303" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-20_14-25-40-362dcd04f73bfbc520ae8e9fa6c8d2d2.png" width="467"></figure><p>Using what you've learnt (and some creativity/Googling) figure out how to get your Selenium bot to apply to all the jobs on the page. Clicking on each job on the left hand side in-turn and applying to each one automatically.</p><p>HINT: Selenium has a custom exception that gets raised when an element cannot be found it's called <code>NoSuchElementException</code> </p><p>You'll need to import it to use it:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException</pre><p><br></p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/1608c284c67d3601d6179edbb6346140" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SOLUTION</a></p>
