# 🐢 Turtle Race Game | Day 19 - 100 Days of Python Bootcamp

Welcome to **Day 19** of the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp**, where we build a fun, colorful **Turtle Race Game** using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics module! 🎉

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a mini graphical race simulation where:
- 6 turtles of different colors race across the screen
- The user is asked to place a bet on which turtle (color) they think will win
- The turtles move forward by a random distance in each iteration
- The game declares if the user wins or loses based on the result

This interactive and visual game is an awesome way to practice:
- Python OOP with classes like `Turtle` and `Screen`
- Event handling and user input
- Loops and conditionals
- Using randomness to simulate real-world behavior
