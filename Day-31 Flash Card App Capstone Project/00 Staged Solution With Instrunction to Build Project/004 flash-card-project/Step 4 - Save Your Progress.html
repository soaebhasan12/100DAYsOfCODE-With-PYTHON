<p>1. When the user presses on the  button, it means that they know the current word on the flashcard and that word should be removed from the list of words that might come up. </p><p>e.g. If french_words.csv had only 3 records:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">chaque,each
parl,speak
arriv,come</pre><p>After the user has seen <code>parl,speak</code>&nbsp; it should be <strong>removed</strong> from the list of words that can come up again.</p><p>2. The updated data should be saved to a new file called <strong>words_to_learn.csv</strong></p><p>e.g. words_to_learn.csv</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">chaque,each
arriv,come</pre><p>3. The next time the program is run, it should check if there is a words_to_learn.csv file. If it exists, the program should use those words to put on the flashcards. If the words_to_learn.csv does not exist (i.e., the first time the program is run), then it should use the words in the french_words.csv</p><p>We want our flashcard program to only test us on things we don't know. So if the user presses the  button, that means the current card should not come up again.</p><p>e.g.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-07-09_10-14-46-80b0cbdc6811561ae9b2aa96e9785a66.gif"></figure><p>HINTS:</p><p>1. The <code>remove()</code> method can remove elements from a list. e.g. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_remove.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_remove.asp</a></p><p>2. You can create a new csv file from a dictionary using <code>DataFrame.to_csv()</code> e.g. <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html</a></p><p>3. If you don't want to create an index for the new csv, you can set the <code>index</code> parameter to <code>False</code>. e.g. </p><p><code>data.to_csv("filename.csv", index=False)</code> </p>
