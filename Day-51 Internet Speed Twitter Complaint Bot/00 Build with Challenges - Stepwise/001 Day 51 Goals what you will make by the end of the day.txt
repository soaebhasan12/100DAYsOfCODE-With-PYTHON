ðŸ““ Day 51 â€“ Lecture 001: Project Goals (Minimal Notes)
Goal:
Build a Python bot that automatically tweets to your internet provider when your internet speed is lower than what you're paying for.

Example Use Case:
If you're paying for 150 Mbps but getting only 23 Mbps, the bot will test your internet speed and tweet a complaint on your behalf.

Tools Needed:

speedtest.net â€“ for measuring internet speed
Selenium â€“ for automating the browser to run speed tests
Twitter â€“ for posting complaints using an automated bot

Core Idea:
Internet companies respond faster to public complaints on Twitter because it's visible to everyone.

Concepts Introduced:
Automation using Python
Real-world problem solving with bots
Public social media interaction as a customer support tool
Internet speed: download/upload (measured in Mbps)

ðŸ§  Interview Highlights
â€¢ Selenium is used when a website has no free API available
â€¢ Twitter is a great way to reach companies fast because complaints are public
â€¢ Bots can help automate tedious or repetitive tasks like speed testing and tweeting
â€¢ Real-world example: Comcast user auto-tweeting complaints based on actual speed test
