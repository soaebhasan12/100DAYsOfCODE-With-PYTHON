# Day 24: Working with Files, Directories, and Paths

## Overview
Welcome to Day 24 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, we focus on working with the local file system, understanding directories, and manipulating files using Python. By the end of the day, you will have improved your previous Snake game and created a project to automate repetitive tasks.

---

## Goals for the Day
1. **Learn File System Operations**:
   - Reading from files.
   - Writing to files.
   - Appending data to files.
   - Managing directories.

2. **Enhance the Snake Game**:
   - Add a **High Score** feature:
     - Track the highest score achieved in the game.
     - Save the high score to a file.
     - Update the high score when a new record is achieved.

3. **Automate Tasks with Python**:
   - Create a **Mail Merge Project**:
     - Generate personalized letters or emails.
     - Replace placeholders (e.g., `[name]`) in a template with actual names from a list.
     - Save the personalized letters in a directory, ready to send.

## Projects

### 1. **Snake Game with High Score**
- **Objective**: Improve the Snake game by adding a high score feature.
- **Features**:
  - Save the high score to a file (`data.txt`).
  - Update the high score when a new record is achieved.
  - Reset the game while retaining the high score.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - File reading and writing.
  - Managing game state.

### 2. **Mail Merge Project**
- **Objective**: Automate the creation of personalized letters or emails.
- **Features**:
  - Use a template letter (`starting_letter.txt`) with placeholders (e.g., `[name]`).
  - Replace placeholders with names from a list (`invited_names.txt`).
  - Save the personalized letters in a directory (`ReadyToSend`).
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - File reading and writing.
  - String manipulation.
  - Automating repetitive tasks.

---

## Why This Matters
- **Practical Applications**:
  - Automating repetitive tasks saves time and effort.
  - File manipulation is a critical skill for many real-world applications.
- **Real-Life Use Cases**:
  - Generating personalized invitations, emails, or letters.
  - Keeping track of high scores or other persistent data in games.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Standard Library**:
  - `open()` for file operations.
  - String methods like `replace()` and `strip()` for text manipulation.
- **Turtle Graphics**:
  - Used for the Snake game.

---

## While Running
- **Don't forget to change directry path based on your system folder**

---

## Outcomes
By the end of the day, you will:
- Understand how to work with files and directories in Python.
- Enhance your Snake game with a persistent high score feature.
- Automate the creation of personalized letters using Python.

Happy coding!
