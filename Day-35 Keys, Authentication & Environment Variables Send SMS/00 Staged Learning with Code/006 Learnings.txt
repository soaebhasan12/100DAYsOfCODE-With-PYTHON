006 Use PythonAnywhere to Automate the Python Script

PythonAnywhere Deployment - Key Notes
Uploading Script

Delete old files (main.py, birthdays.csv)

Upload new main.py directly to user folder (no subfolders)

Running Script

bash
python3 main.py
Error Fix: Free accounts need proxy config for Twilio:

python
from twilio.http.http_client import TwilioHttpClient
import os
proxy_client = TwilioHttpClient(proxy={'http': os.environ['http_proxy'], 'https': os.environ['https_proxy']})
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token, http_client=proxy_client)
Scheduling Tasks

Free Account: 1 scheduled task allowed

Command: python3 main.py

Frequency: Set to daily at desired time (UTC)

Convert local time to UTC (e.g., 7 AM BST = 6 AM UTC)

Test: Adjust time to current UTC to verify SMS delivery

Key Points

Paid accounts remove task limits and proxy issues

Task logs confirm execution (check Queued status)

Next Step: Monitor logs to ensure consistent execution.

Why This Matters: Automates rain alerts without local execution, leveraging cloud scheduling.
