Summary: 002 What is API Authentication and Why Do We Need to Authenticate Ourselves

- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow us to access data from providers, but valuable data often requires authentication.
- Free APIs usually offer simple data, while valuable data (like weather or financial info) is often paid due to the cost of collecting and maintaining it.
- API providers use API keys to control access, track usage, and prevent abuse of free tiers.
- API keys work like a personal account number and password for the API.
- Most APIs require authentication, usually via an API key, especially for commercial or high-usage scenarios.
- Free tiers are available for learning, but heavy users or companies need to pay.
- Next steps: Learn to use the OpenWeatherMap API, authenticate with an API key, and fetch live weather data.
