Summary: 003 Using API Keys to Authenticate and Get the Weather from OpenWeatherMap

- Always read the API documentation before using a new API.

- OpenWeatherMap provides multiple APIs (current weather, hourly forecast, etc.), each with its own endpoint and parameters.

- To use the API, you need to sign up, get your own API key (App ID), and include it as a parameter in your requests.

- You can test the API by making a request with your city and API key; a valid key returns weather data, while an invalid key returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

- The One Call API provides current, hourly, and daily weather data based on latitude and longitude.

- Use the `requests` library in Python to make API calls, passing parameters like `lat`, `lon`, and `appid`.

- The API returns data in JSON format, which can be viewed and analyzed using online JSON viewers.

- Practice reading API docs and making requests, as every API has its own structure and requirements.

- In this lesson, you learned to authenticate with an API key and fetch weather data for your location.
