# Pong Game – Classic Arcade Game 🕹️

Welcome to the **Pong Game** project! This is a Python implementation of the classic Pong arcade game, built using the `turtle` module. The game is designed to be simple yet fun, and it demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Python.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Two players** control the paddles:
  - Player 1 (Left Paddle): Use the `W` key to move up and the `S` key to move down.
  - Player 2 (Right Paddle): Use the `Up Arrow` key to move up and the `Down Arrow` key to move down.
- The goal is to hit the ball with your paddle and prevent it from going past your side.
- If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
- The game keeps track of the score and increases the ball's speed after each paddle hit.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- **`main.py`**: The main game loop and logic. Run this file to start the game.
- **`Paddle.py`**: Contains the `Paddle` class, which handles paddle creation and movement.
- **`Ball.py`**: Contains the `Ball` class, which handles ball movement, bouncing, and resetting.
- **`ScoreBoard.py`**: Contains the `ScoreBoard` class, which tracks and displays the score.

# 🧱 Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is built using classes for modularity and reusability.
- **Collision Detection**: The ball bounces off walls and paddles.
- **Score Tracking**: A scoreboard keeps track of the players' scores.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The ball's speed increases after each paddle hit.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional libraries are required; the game uses Python's built-in `turtle` module.

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Add sound effects for paddle hits and scoring.
- Implement a start screen and game over screen.
- Add AI for single-player mode.
