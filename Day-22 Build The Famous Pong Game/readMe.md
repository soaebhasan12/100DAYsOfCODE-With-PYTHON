# Pong Game – Day 22 of 100 Days of Code 🕹️

Welcome to **Day 22** of the **#100DaysOfCode** journey.  
In this session, we're going to build the **classic Pong Game** using everything you've learned so far.

---

## 🎮 What is Pong?

**Pong** is one of the first arcade video games ever made.  
It's a simple 2D game simulating table tennis, where:

- A ball moves across the screen
- Two players control vertical paddles
- If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores

Despite its simplicity, it’s a powerful project to consolidate your foundational coding skills.

---

## 🧠 The Idea Behind the Project

- This version of Pong is built using object-oriented programming concepts.
- You will design classes to handle different components of the game (like paddles, ball, scoreboard).
- You'll implement collision detection, scoring logic, and movement mechanics.

---

## 🧱 Game Components Breakdown

Before diving into code, we break the game down into **smaller pieces**:

### 🎯 Core Components:
- `Screen`: The game window
- `Paddle`: Player paddles (two of them)
- `Ball`: The bouncing ball
- `Scoreboard`: To track scores

---

## 🗂️ Suggested Class Structure

You might want to separate logic using these classes:

- `Paddle`: Handles player input and paddle movement
- `Ball`: Handles movement, wall bounce, and collision with paddle
- `Scoreboard`: Tracks and displays scores
- `Game`: (Optional) Coordinates the game loop and logic

---

## 📝 Your Task

Here’s how you can approach this:

1. Open a blank Python project
2. Draw out (on paper or digitally) what components you need
3. Identify what logic goes into which class
4. Think of methods like `move()`, `bounce()`, `score()`, etc.
5. Start implementing step-by-step

---

## 📋 Game Development Roadmap

Here's how we’ll build this game step-by-step:

1. Create the game window (screen)
2. Add one paddle and implement movement
3. Add the second paddle
4. Add the ball and make it move constantly
5. Implement wall collision detection for the ball
6. Detect collision between ball and paddles
7. Implement scoring system
8. Show scores using a scoreboard

---

## 🔁 How to Practice

You’ve got two options:

- **Feeling Confident?**  
  Create a blank project and start building from scratch using the above roadmap.

- **Prefer Guidance?**  
  Follow along with the instructional videos step-by-step.

Either way, you’ll gain a deep understanding of game logic and Python classes. 🚀

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Turtle module** (for graphics and game loop)

---

## 💡 Tips

- Keep a notepad or sketchbook handy for planning your game logic.
- Write clean, modular code – use one class per file if possible.
- Always test individual components before combining them.

## 📦 Final Thoughts

This project is a significant step up from previous games like Snake.  
It challenges you to think in terms of design, logic, and object-oriented principles.

Stick with it—debugging is part of the game dev experience.  
And once it works, you'll love seeing your Pong game come to life. 🎉

Happy coding! 💻✨
