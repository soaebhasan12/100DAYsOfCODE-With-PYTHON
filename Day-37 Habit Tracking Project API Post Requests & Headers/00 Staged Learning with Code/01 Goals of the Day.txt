# Day 37: Habit Tracking with Pixela API - Goals of the Day

## 📌 Key Topics Covered
- **Advanced Authentication**: Working with headers in API requests
- **HTTP Methods**: Making POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using Python's `requests` module
- **Pixela API**: Introduction to this Japanese-developed habit tracking service

## 🚀 Project Overview
Building a digital version of Simone Giertz's physical habit tracker:
- Track daily habits with visual progress
- Record intensity/quantity (not just binary completion)
- Maintain streaks and motivation

## 🌟 Pixela Features Highlighted
- Visual calendar-style tracking
- Color gradients to show intensity levels
- Long-term progress visualization (yearly views)
- Supports quantitative tracking (pages read, km cycled, etc.)

## 🛠️ Potential Habit Tracking Applications
- Coding practice time
- Meditation minutes
- Exercise/cycling distance
- Reading progress (pages per day)
- Swimming lengths

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of the project, students will:
1. Understand advanced API authentication
2. Master HTTP methods beyond GET
3. Create a personalized habit tracker
4. Have a tool to support their goal achievement

> "Whatever habit you're trying to build, you'll have a tool to help achieve your goals by the end of today's project."
